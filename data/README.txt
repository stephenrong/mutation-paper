Downloaded human hg19 coding domain sequences for protein coding genes from UCSC Table Browser on 2018/06/22: GRCh37/hg19 (assembly), Genes and Gene Predictions (group), UniProt (track), SwissProt Aln. (table), genome (region), sequence (output format), genomic (Select sequence type for UCSC Genes), CDS exons only + One FASTA record per gene + All upper case. UniProt SwissProt is manually annotated and non-redundant.

Downloaded ERV mutation rate estimates from Carlson et al. 2017 from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/05/108290.figures-only on 2018-05-21. Used to create derivative files 108290-* and mu-matrix-* using mu_sims_matrix.R.

Downloaded RESCUE-ESE hexamers identified in Fairbrother et al. 2002 from http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/rescue-ese/ESE.txt on 2018-07-12. (Not used in manuscript).

Received ERVheps_chasin.txt from chrine through Slack on 2018-06-04, and chasin_ESS_ESE_numbers.txt from chrine through Slack on 2018-06-14, and hexamers_ERVaveraged.txt from chrine through Slack on 2018-07-19. Original provenance of chasin_ESS_ESE_numbers.txt from Supplementary Table 1 of Ke et al. 2011.
